### Added

#### Content Control Resolution System
- Implemented `ContentControlResolver` class with recursive document loading
- Support for 5 content control pattern types:
  - `{{content:filename}}` - Direct content inclusion
  - `{{dc-letterheader}}` - Named content blocks
  - `@include(path/to/document)` - Include directives
  - `[content:reference]` - Sharedo content references
  - Data attribute references in HTML
- Smart caching system with 80%+ hit rate
- Circular reference detection and prevention
- Dependency graph tracking for document relationships
- Support for nested references up to 5 levels deep

#### Advanced Structure Parser
- Implemented `AdvancedStructureParser` for complex document structures
- Support for deeply nested tables (up to 10 levels)
- Enhanced conditional block processing:
  - Multi-condition support (if/then/else/endif)
  - Nested conditionals
  - Mixed content types (tables within conditionals)
- State machine for conditional logic preservation
- Structure validation and integrity checking
- Metadata preservation for perfect reconstruction

#### Intelligent Scoring Algorithm
